## Web Deployment on ***[here](https://interactive-periodic-table-9h8r.onrender.com/)***
***Deployment has been changed from GitHub Pages to Render due to less difficulty in hiding environment secrets & easier node deployment. While the GitHub Pages version will stay as it is, it will not be able to fetch API for data in the periodic table.***

# Features

- Responsive table
- Hovering/Selection effects and animations

**Details on each elements such as:**

- Summary/Description
- Atomic Number
- Atomic Mass
- Category
- Appearance
- Melting point/Boiling point

and ***[more](FEATURES.md)***!

# Future Plans
I'll be working & improving on the features that already exists, maybe even making some more quality of life features too if I feel like it.

**For now, these are my plans:**

- Enlarged & draggable table
- Animations for element details dialog/popup
- Better UX/UI designs (maybe)

I'm planning on improving the readability and decreasing the complexity of the source code by finding an appropriate **Javascript framework**. I'm still deciding whether to use Vue.js or React.js, I'll update this by the time I finally pick one to work with.

# Personal notes

This is just a tiny little project I made out of my own interests, and mainly for practicing [Hypertext Markup Language 5 (HTML)](https://www.w3.org/html/), [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](https://www.w3schools.com/css/), and for me to learn [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for fetching API.
